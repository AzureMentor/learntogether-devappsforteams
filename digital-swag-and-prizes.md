# Learn Together - Developing Apps for Teams (Digital Swag and Prizes) 

## Digital Swag

Let's get to the good stuff. What swag will be offered at this event and the foreseeable future? Glad you asked!

**Plant Trees to Benefit the Enviroment and Local Economies**

Every email, livestream, and action emits carbon and our goal is to be net-zero carbon neutral. Transparency is key and the Microsoft Developer Relations Event Team is still learning, but we are prioritizing sustainability efforts for our digital experiences. We have partnered with [Ecosia](https://info.ecosia.org/about), a search engine that plants trees for every search. 

Additionally, this event specifically has gifted 960 trees to tackle climate change. You can add the [Ecosia extension](https://www.ecosia.org/) to your selected browser and visit the [Ecosia Pop-Up store](https://plant.ecosia.org/) to give and gift more trees!

**Tech Stretch**

I do not know about you, but I need to get up from my chair, couch, stool and stretch my legs! This tech stretch one-pager is great for taking a quick break from the screen and prioritizing your wellbeing with our guided stretches.
